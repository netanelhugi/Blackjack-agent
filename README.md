# Reinforcement Learning On Blackjack

In this project we built a RL model that will teach the computer (our agent) how to play blackjack. 
The project goal is to reduce player’s loss, by finding the best strategy for a blackjack player, which will increase the odds of the player to win the dealer. Despite our learning technique, the odds are still in favor of the casino, so our goal is only to reduce the player’s loss.
